                        <p>Welcome to the website GETSETGIG (the "Site") and related platforms, products, and services available on or from the Site (the "Services") are owned and operated by GETSETGIG (together with its affiliates, successors, and assigns hereinafter referred to as "our", "we", "us", or "GETSETGIG").</p>
                <p>The Site is a music-oriented content and information website that provides an online platform connecting musical artists, bands, performers with event agencies, entertainment buyers and the likes. Registered users may post music, sound recordings, musical works, compositions, videos, photographs, pictures, graphics, names, likeness, images, biographical information, and other information or materials owned and/or created by them and can view each other's profiles ("Profiles"), communicate with each other, share photos, post comments, and describe their interests.</p>
                <p>GETSETGIG cares about online privacy and wants you to know how we collect, use and share and protect information about you and the choices you have regarding our use of your information. If you have any questions concerning this Privacy Policy, please email us at privacy@getsetgig.com. We may change or add to this Privacy Policy from time-to-time, so we encourage you to review it periodically.</p>

                <h3 className="terms-small-title">SCOPE</h3>
                <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the collection of personal information from users of the Services, including any updated and new products or services that may be offered in the future by GETSETGIG. It relates to information we collect from you, including personally identifying information (also referred to as"PII") and information that does not identify you personally. PII may include, for example, some or all of the following: your name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, mobile phone number, user name and password, and demographic information.</p>
                <h3 className="terms-small-title">YOUR CONSENT TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
                <p>By using the Services and this Site, you consent to our General Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy, including our use and disclosure of your personal information as stated in this Privacy Policy, whether or not you register with the Site.</p>
                <h3 className="terms-small-title">INFORMATION COLLECTED AND USED BY GETSETGIG</h3>
                <p>When users register with the Site, GETSETGIG collects user submitted personal information such as name, mailing address, email address, telephone number and age. GETSETGIG uses that information to authenticate users and to send notifications to users relating to, without limitation, the Services and other opportunities.</p>
                <p>As is standard practice on many corporate websites, GETSETGIG also logs non-personally-identifiable information, including IP address, profile information, aggregate user data, and browser type, from the Site. This data is used to improve the website services, to analyze trends, to administer the Site, to track users' movements around the Site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. GETSETGIG will not use the information collected to market directly to that person. This non-personally-identifiable information may be shared with third-parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements to users. User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes.</p>
                <p>User Profile information, including users’ pictures and names, is displayed to people in order to facilitate artist booking.</p>
                <p>GETSETGIG may also use a user’s email address to send updates, a newsletter or news regarding the Services. We may send email messages which use a "click-through URL" linked to content on the Site. When a user clicks one of these URLs, they pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page. </p>
                <p>In cases where you use a mobile device to access our sites or use or applications, we may receive information about the location of your device. We may use this information to develop, deliver, and improve our products, services, and other offerings.</p>
                <p>We use the information that we collect to develop, deliver, and improve our products, services, and other offerings.</p>
                <h3 className="terms-small-title">EXTERNAL LINKS</h3>
                <p>This site contains links to other sites. GETSETGIG is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.</p>
                <h3 className="terms-small-title">REGISTRATION FORMS</h3>
                <p>Contact information from the registration forms is used to create a unique record to identify the user to the system and for sending information to the member, but is not used for any other purpose. We never sell or rent our users’ information. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. This is used for your profiles and is made available to talent buying members for the purpose of contacting you in the event that they would like to make a gig inquiry.</p>
                <h3 className="terms-small-title">DATA RETENTION</h3>
                <p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at contact@getsetgig.com. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

                <h3 className="terms-small-title">COOKIES</h3>
                <p>Our site uses cookies to save unique key information so you don’t have to re-enter your password each time you visit a page on the site. The cookie is session-based (sits in the header information sent to the server) and is destroyed after you close your browser. The cookie neither reads nor writes anything to or from your computer, but cookies must be enabled to use the site as a member.</p>

                <h3 className="terms-small-title">PRIVACY FOR CHILDREN AND MINORS</h3>
                <p>Protecting the privacy of children is important to us. We will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, you are not allowed to become a registered member of GETSETGIG unless a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use registers you on your behalf. It is important to remember that we cannot always determine that a member is a child under the age of 18. Members under the age of 18 must have written parental consent to release their name or other personal information.</p>

                <h3 className="terms-small-title">PRACTICES OF THIRD PARTIES</h3>
                <p>We cannot control, and are not responsible for, any third party’s use of cookies, web beacons or other technology to collect information about an individual. Advertising agencies, advertising networks, and other companies who place advertisements on Websites, email messages and on the Internet may use this or other technology to collect information about you.</p>

                <h3 className="terms-small-title">TESTIMONIALS</h3>
                <p>We post customer notable quotes on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information such as the customer’s name. We do obtain the customer’s consent prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial. </p>

                <h3 className="terms-small-title">CHAT, PROFILES AND BLOG MESSAGE BOARDS</h3>
                <p>Please be aware that whenever you voluntarily post public information to Chat Rooms, Profiles, Message Boards or any other Public Forum, that information can be accessed by the public and can in turn be used by those people to send you unsolicited communications. We are not responsible for the personally information you choose to submit and make publicly available on the Site. Please think before you post any personal information online.</p>


                <h3 className="terms-small-title">USING SOCIAL FEATURES OF OUR APPLICATIONS</h3>
                <p>Our social features promote and facilitate interaction among our site users, such as by allowing our users to promote a show or band. In order to protect the application users’ privacy, we will only show you this information if they previously opted in to use the same social feature you are using.</p>


                <h3 className="terms-small-title">EMAIL CHOICE / OPT OUT</h3>
                <p>Users who no longer wish to receive promotional messages or updates may choose not to by opting-out. To opt-out, simply log-in to your user Account, and click the appropriate box to disable the notification emails you no longer wish to receive. All notification emails and GETSETGIG newsletters also include the above instructions for opting-out of those communications in the future. Note that users who have opted-out of promotional messages or updates may still receive email messages from GETSETGIG where necessary to provide a service you have requested or where necessary to inform you of critical information relating to your use of the Site.</p>


                <h3 className="terms-small-title">THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING</h3>
                <p>GETSETGIG or one of our web-advertising partners may deliver ads appearing on GETSETGIG to users of our Site. Our web-advertising partners may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers only the use of cookies by GETSETGIG and does not cover the use of cookies by any third party advertisers. Please be aware, however, that to the extent Google may deliver ads to our website it uses the DART cookie. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy. </p>

                <h3 className="terms-small-title">SECURITY</h3>
                <p>GETSETGIG user accounts are secured by user-created passwords. GETSETGIG takes precautions to ensure that account information is kept private. GETSETGIG uses reasonable measures such as encryption to protect private information that is stored within our database against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction, and we restrict access to such private information to those employees who need access to perform their job functions, such as our customer service personnel and technical staff. Please note that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, however, and GETSETGIG cannot guarantee the security of user account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of member information at any time. Users are urged to also take precautions to protect their personal data by changing passwords often using  combination of letters and numbers, and using a secure web browser.</p>

                <h3 className="terms-small-title">SHARING AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION GETSETGIG COLLECTS</h3>
                <p>Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, GETSETGIG will not disclose personal information to any third party unless it believes that disclosure is necessary: (1) to conform to legal requirements or to respond to a FIR, search warrant or other legal process received by GETSETGIG, whether or not a response is required by applicable law; (2) to enforce the General Terms and Conditions or to protect our rights; or (3) to protect the safety of members of the public and users of the Services. GETSETGIG reserves the right to transfer personal information to a successor in interest that acquires rights to that information as a result of the sale of GETSETGIG or substantially all of its assets to that successor in interest. </p>
